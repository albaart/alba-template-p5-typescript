## Alba p5 Typescript template

This is a template for creating generative artwork which works with the Alba.art platform.

### Quickstart

1. Click "Use this template" (or clone the repo).
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` for a development environment.

### Building for Alba

When you're ready to add your code to the Alba platform, use the command `npm run build`. This will create a file in the `dist` directory called `index.<hash>.js`. You should be able to copy the content of that file directly into the Alba platform.

### See an example

There is an `example.ts` file which shows an implementation of a simple project. You can use this as a reference, or run `npm run example` to see it live.
